In <<Getting started with the REST-API>> the permissions were shortly mentioned. In this section the underlying concept of accessibility is explained more precisely.
There are three types of accessibility rights: read, edit and contribute permissions.
Editors can read and edit pages and their attachments. In addition to editors, readers have read-only access to pages which do not override this setting. Contributors are allowed to create new pages in respective workspaces. They may only read/edit pages to which they are explicitly assigned as readers/editors.
Accessibility rules can be inherited from the containing workspace or from parent entities. By default, newly created entities will inherit readers and editors from their workspace.

In order to change the permissions to workspaces or certain entities, the REST-API or the server user interface (https://server.sociocortex.com) can be used:

=== Add reader to workspace

For the _SocioCortex REST-API_, we take the workspace created in <<Creating a workspace>> and add another reader to the workspace. In our case this is a user with the id _aosqsp1qsrfa_ which we simply add to the array of readers in the permissions object.
