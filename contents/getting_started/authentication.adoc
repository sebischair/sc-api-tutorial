In order to get started with _SocioCortex_, we first need to create an account to be able to create an own workspace as well as other entities.

==== Registering a new user (POST)

*Request:*
[source,bash]
POST https://server.sociocortex.com/api/v1/users
BODY
{
    "name":"$NAME",
    "email":"$EMAIL@ADDRESS.com",
    "password":"$PASSWORD"
}

*Response:*
[source,json]
{
  "isVerified": false,
  "locale": "de-DE",
  "mayCreateWorkspace": false,
  "mayCreateGroup": false,
  "id": "$ID",
  "versions": [],
  "email": "$EMAIL@ADDRESS.com",
  "name": "$NAME",
  "href": "https://server.sociocortex.com/api/v1/users/$ID",
  "mayEdit": true,
  "isAdministrator": false,
  "mayCreateUser": false,
  "groups": []
}

After having successfully send this information to the server, we check the respective provided email account for an email containing an activation link for _SocioCortex_.

Once we click the link in the email, the account is activated and we are ready to go.

==== Log in to _SocioCortex_

There are two ways to log in to _SocioCortex_, either by HTTP Basic authentication or by using JSON Web Tokens (JWT, https://jwt.io/). Throughout this tutorial we will be using the predefined HTTP requests from the Postman-Collection. Therefore, we encourage you to simply replace the placeholder _$TOKEN_ in all the Postman requests with your own JWT (see <<JWT>>).

===== Basic Auth

Basic Auth requires to send a respective HTTP Authorization Header in every request to the server. This Authorization Header contains a username and password combined with a single colon and base64-encoded with a "Basic" prefix, denoting the authorization method. Thus, it does not require any cookies, session identifiers or tokens provided and signed by the server.

An example request to get a users details could be the following:

*Request:*
[source,bash]
GET https://server.sociocortex.com/api/v1/users/me
Authorization: Basic $BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS

===== JWT

A JWT can be received by providing the credentials to the server in the payload of a HTTP POST request. The token has an expiry date in its payload as well as user information.

*Request:*
[source,bash]
POST https://server.sociocortex.com/api/v1/jwt
BODY
{
    "username":"$EMAIL@ADDRESS.com",
    "password":"$PASSWORD"
}

*Response:*
[source,json]
{
  "token": "$TOKEN",
  "payload": {
    "exp": "$EXPIRY_DATE",
    "sub": "$USER_ID",
    "name": "$NAME"
  }
}

After having received the token, the token is sent with every request on access-restricted resources in a respective HTTP Authorization Header with the prefix "Bearer".

An example request to get a users details could be the following:

*Request:*
[source,bash]
GET https://server.sociocortex.com/api/v1/users/me
Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN
