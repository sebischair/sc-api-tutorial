The demo scenario that will serve as a real world example to demonstrate the usage of the _SocioCortex REST-API_ is a simple publication management system.

Before we can start with the actual scenario, we check that the authentication is working for your credentials and shortly outline the differences of jwt and basic auth.

Once the authentication works, we create a workspace which we then use to store the required entity types in. We identify the required entity types as _publication_ and _conference_.
The latter we use to add entities, i.e. publications or conferences, to the workspace with respective entity types.

Furthermore, tasks and their definitions are introduced and combined with the attribute definitions of entity types.

While going through the demo scenario all HTTP verbs will be taken into account in order to make you feel comfortable with all kinds of actions necessary to interact with the _SocioCortex REST-API_.

==== Structure of resource URIs

Example URI for accessing all resources of type entityType within a workspace with a specific ID:

Additionally, one can provide query parameters to further refine for instance the requested meta attributes. More on query parameters can be found in <<Query Parameters>>.
