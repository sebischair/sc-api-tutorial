=== Running your own SocioCortex server instance

If you want to run your own SocioCortex server, you'll find instructions and all necessary files for an on-premise installation https://server.sociocortex.com/pages/12nwc2038m7y3/Getting-started-with-SC-server-deployment[here].

As you will work with a different server domain as the sebis SocioCortex server, you need to adjust all the URIs in the Postman collection throughout this tutorial and replace _server.sociocortex.com_ with your respective server url (e.g. if running the server locally _localhost:8083_).

=== Working with sebis SocioCortex server

If you want to work with the server instance provided by the sebis chair, you can do so by simply registering on https://server.sociocortex.com (see image below).

Alternatively, you can register over the REST-API itself as outlined in the upcoming section <<Authentication>>.

=== Postman setup

Postman is an application which is used to test and develop APIs. Its straightforward UI enables developers to send custom HTTP requests very comfortably.
It can either be downloaded here: https://www.getpostman.com/

Or by simply clicking the button below:

<div class="postman-run-button"
data-postman-action="collection/import"
data-postman-var-1="c5f085c61bab315e993d"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function (p,o,s,t,m,a,n) {
    !p[s] && (p[s] = function () { (p[t] || (p[t] = [])).push(arguments); });
    !o.getElementById(s+t) && o.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild((
      (n = o.createElement("script")),
      (n.id = s+t), (n.async = 1), (n.src = m), n
    ));
  }(window, document, "_pm", "PostmanRunObject", "https://run.pstmn.io/button.js"));
</script>
